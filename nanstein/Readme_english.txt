- This mod can be installed / uninstalled without causing any problem to install BG2(EE).

To uninstall:

II. DETAILS OF MOD:

I created this mod as training to distract me deal with exams and other things in life everyday, he has no vocation to become a mod or a major technical achievement, the intention was to move a good time to create something entertaining and least well done.
Nanstein blacksmith is a new face that appears to Cromwell in the docks, it can transform objects into other legends that may be more useful depending on the style of play, or at least more original.
I would not advise you to attack, you will not get any objects that forge ... and you died. (if someone happens to survive the looting and I tip my hat to him.)
